        "ans":"Yes, possible. Let's calculate. House rent (you can stay in the building if you want or in tinsheet) Because of your financial problems, you don't have to live in that flat. You can have a simple home or even a tin sheet if you want. And in such a mess one can rent 1000-1200 / - per seat."

        "ans":"The maximum mess rate here is 30-34 rupees.If you run a flower mill for 30 days, your food will cost around Rs. 2550 / -. Since you are ready for admission with a little money, so here you can save 1200 / - per month if you work a little hard. Then it will be seen that the cost of food will be within 1500-1600 / - rupees. If you say how it is, then listen  you will run the mill every morning because 0.5 mill is caught in the morning (which costs 14-15 rupees). And run a mill at noon and you can eat in two at noon and at night in that mill. Then you will save a lot. The amount of rice you give can be easily eaten twice. If you have a vegetable problem one day, you can fry an egg and eat it. It may seem ridiculous to you, but there are many brothers in Gazipur who work hard to get admission and succeed. However, you may have to know in advance that there may be some rules for mess."

        "ans":"Brother, you will not buy any clothes for 9 months. You already have some or some clothes. Do a little trouble with these nine months. If Allah accepts you in duet in return, you will see how much you are worth. You can also earn at least 5000-6000 / month per month by doing private tuition. Even after that you can make 200-300 rupees per month for afternoon snacks or some hand expenses."
